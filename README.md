# Random-Pass-Fix

homework for week 3 challenge

# Recap

```
did prompts with if else statements to have the user declare what they want their random password to consist of
at the end i combined the users asnwers to make a string for what the random password can include
then i returned that value and set it to password

only thing i was stuck on was how to keep making the user get the same promt when entering a value thats no valid
i tried to redirect them to a promt but the way i set my values it will only ask twice and still work properly
```
